Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is therefore critical for a multitude of reasons: to optimize the operational efficiency of grids, to effectively balance energy supply and demand, to enhance the planning and execution of energy storage strategies, to minimize the reliance on backup power sources, and ultimately, to reduce operational costs within renewable energy infrastructures. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning approach designed to improve the accuracy of wind power forecasting through the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with an attention mechanism. The model's efficacy was rigorously evaluated using high-resolution data, recorded at 10-minute intervals, from two distinct meteorological stations located in Khomein, Saveh and Tafresh, Iran. The performance of the hybrid model was benchmarked against traditional machine learning methodologies, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and standalone LSTM networks. The results of the evaluation demonstrate the superior performance of the hybrid LSTM-Attention model, which achieved notable coefficient of determination (R²) values of 0.9812 and 0.9911 at the Khomein, Saveh and Tafresh stations, respectively, indicating significant advancements in forecasting accuracy compared to the other models. These enhanced forecasting capabilities have significant implications for facilitating the efficient integration of wind energy into electrical grids, thereby enabling more effective grid management practices and supporting optimized energy distribution strategies.">

The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of wind patterns using a combination of statistical approaches and artificial intelligence techniques. Wind data was collected from advanced meteorological stations in these cities over a two-year period (2018–2020), including detailed measurements of wind speed and direction at 10-minute intervals. This high-resolution dataset facilitated an in-depth examination of wind behavior and its suitability for energy production. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Weibull distribution and wind rose diagrams, which provided insights into the wind characteristics and their spatial variations. Additionally, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were employed to predict wind speeds and temporal trends. These models effectively captured the complex relationships within the wind data and produced highly accurate forecasts. The comparison of actual and predicted wind rose diagrams demonstrated a strong alignment, validating the reliability of the LSTM-based predictions in reflecting real-world wind patterns. The results of this study demonstrate that combining traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning techniques provides a robust framework for analyzing wind energy potential. By leveraging these tools, the study offers valuable insights for sustainable energy planning and supports informed decision-making for renewable energy investments in Markazi Province.">

However, such hardware adds complexity and costs. This research demonstrates a virtual sensing approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict wind direction solely from historical wind speed data. The LSTM networks were trained on two years of 10-minute resolution data from three stations in Iran's Markazi Province. The models accurately inferred wind directionality and speeds based on temporal analysis of speeds. Predictions closely matched measured wind direction per wind rose validation. The research indicates software-based artificial intelligence algorithms can effectively replace physical wind direction sensors, enabling simpler and cheaper wind farms. Operational reliability can be ensured via continual model updating. The approach also has promising implications for broader wind forecasting applications. Overall, the feasibility of transitioning from physical hardware to virtual software-based wind sensors is demonstrated.">

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a tool with potential for studying neural processes in anxiety disorders including claustrophobia. In this work, a machine learning algorithm for differentiation between claustrophobic and healthy controls using EEG signals is presented. For 22 subjects, EEG data were collected from 22 participants under controlled conditions, and preprocessing included filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction using relative Power Spectral Density (rPSD across five frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. A diverse range of classification algorithms, such as traditional machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF)—and deep neural networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) integration, was utilized. Performance testing with five-fold cross-validation revealed that MLP and CNN-BiLSTM performed best in terms of accuracy in classification, with a value over 95% when all bands of frequencies were combined together. An analysis of brain regions revealed frontal and temporal regions to differentiate between claustrophobic and non-claustrophobic subjects, and beta and theta bands played a significant role in distinguishing between them. These observations unveil high potential for EEG-based machine learning algorithms in objective evaluation of claustrophobia, and doors for future development in its therapy and diagnosis.">

                        <button class="btn btn-outline btn-abstract" data-abstract="Decision-making is vital in a country's economic and political conditions. Risk is unavoidable in such highly impacting decisions. Therefore, managers must prepare themselves to embrace it effectively. Under the same circumstances with uncertain outcomes, different managers rarely make the same choice. The degree that managers endorse risk-taking behavior is an essential part of their personality and affects their decision-making process. As a growing field, decision neuroscience uses various neuro-imaging techniques to generate neural-level conceptualizations, refine existing phenomenology of the risky behavior in such conditions, and provide appropriate methodologies for evaluating the behavior among managers. Although there are many findings regarding decision-making and cortical activity, resting-state neural activity in risk-taking and risk-averse managers is still an unknown and ongoing issue. In this study, to address this issue, we investigated the potential relationship between risk-taking and brain activity by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 30 managers during a resting state condition. Resting-state EEG data were recorded using a 64-channel system during eyes-closed conditions. We analyzed Power Spectral Density (PSD), Prefrontal Asymmetry Index (PAI), and frequency band ratios (Theta/Beta and Delta/Beta) across delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. Phase Locking Value (PLV) was used to assess functional connectivity patterns. Results revealed significant differences between groups, with risk-averse managers showing higher PAI values in theta, alpha, and beta bands (p < 0.001), while risk-taking managers demonstrated higher PSD variability and distinct delta-band connectivity patterns. Support Vector Machine classification achieved 92.00 ± 11.23% accuracy in the beta band, indicating robust discrimination between risk profiles Conclusions: This study's findings may provide a physiological biomarker to predict risk-taking and risk-averse behaviors in managers.">
